Display video posts to clients on the administration screen. Give your clients a little extra help in the form of a how to video. 

== Description ==

After developing a Wordpress website a client might want to manage the site themselves.  This plugin gives the developer the option of providing "how to" videos to teach the client how to use a certain aspect of the Wordpress install. When an install has become complicated it can be a great time saver to provide the customer with an instructional video that covers the topic.

This plugin does not create videos.  It provides a place to show videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and to upload your own video (size matters).  When creating a site you can link to existing YouTube how to videos that are relevant to your Wordpress install.  Videos that are relevent to the particular client you have created the Website for.

The videos can be displayed by category and users who can view the video can also be controlled by their role.  Choose who you want to be able to view the videos by adjusting the admin help video settings.  The title of the L7 Admin Help Videos page can also be set to customize the clients experience. 

Users can:
<ul>
	<li>Upload a help video.</li>
	<li>Title videos.</li>
	<li>Provide descriptions of the videos.</li>
	<li>Link to external videos.
	<li>Watch videos in the backend.</li>
	<li>Restrict the viewing of the videos.</li>
